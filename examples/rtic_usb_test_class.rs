//! Implements the usb-device test class.
//!
//! This is an important example for USB device testing. It turns your board
//! into a USB device that can be tested from the usb-device host-side testing
//! framework. See the usb-device documentation for more information on the test.
//!
//! The gist of the testing process:
//!
//! 1. Flash this example onto your board. Keep your board connected to your host.
//! 2. Clone the usb-device repository.
//! 3. Run `cargo test` in the usb-device directory.
//!
//! The test harness should detect your board and execute tests against it.
//! All of those tests should pass.
//!
//! If you're playing the benchmark game and optimizing for bulk read / write
//! throughput, configure your runtime to place as much as possible into TCM.
